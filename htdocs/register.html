    <p> <b>Thank you for participating!</b> <br> In order register an account, we need to train the model on your keyboard patterns. <br>
    As of now, ideally <b>you should be on a desktop of laptop </b> for this to properly work.<br>
    To register, all you have to do, is repeatedly type the given password into the container below, and press the submit button after each attempt! <br> 
    The chosen password is: <b>'keyboardist'</b> <br>
    There is no particular scientific reason behind this, other than the fact that it is fairly short and uses many different keys. <br> <br>

    <h3>So to register, follow these steps:</h3>

    <ul class="instruction-list">
        <li>Be on a laptop or desktop!</li>
        <li>Think of a username! It can be anything you can remember easily.</li>
        <li>Write down your username and email in the boxes below!</li>
        <li>Write the word <b>'keyboardist'</b> into the password box, and press submit!</li>
        <li>Repeat the previous step (step 4), until the box is green and a message pops up!</li>
        <li>After 10 or so attempts, the registartion button should appear, click it and you are done!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <h3>Some tips:</h3>
        - Try to type the word as fast as you can! <br>
        - Its okay if you make mistakes, but try to aim for consistency! <br>
        - You can submit more times than needed, which helps the accuracy of the model. <br>
